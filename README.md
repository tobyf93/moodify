# Overview
What does your Spotify playlist say about you?  Moodify lets you analyze music from your personal library or from the playlists that you follow to determine what moods your collection best reflect.

# How Does It Work?
Moods are determined by two factors - energy and valence.  Energy is the measure of intensity or activity of a song.  Valence is how positive/negative the track is perceived as.  The correlation between energy and valence gives us an indication of the mood of the track (see diagram).
