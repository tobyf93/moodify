TODO:
- Re-implement the echonest API used in the old rails app
- Figure out how to process tracks in batches.  Look into how catalogs work.
- May need to do one batch for each playlist as we need to know what playlist a
  track belongs to.
- Re-implement mood logic from rails app
- Return data to client:
[
  {
    id: "abc123",
    tracks: [
      {
        title: "I Miss You",
        artists: "Blink 182",
        mood: "sad"
      }
    ]
  }
]

24/6/2016:
- No longer using Bootstrap (not needed).  Instead using flexbox for application
  layout.  This has >90% browser support which i am more than happy with.
- Create analysePlaylists action in redux to send an array of playlist ID's to
  server.
- API server uses bodyParser to parse incoming JSON data to '/moods' route.
- getPlaylistTracks method called from the Spotify API to get tracks for each
  playlist.  Unfortunately i don't think there is a way of getting tracks for
  more than one playlist at a time.
